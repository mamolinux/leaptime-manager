## ToDo List
**Software:**
1. [x] Apt backup
	1. [ ] Scheduled app backup
2. [x] Apt restore

**Data:**
Data backup should have two modes:
1. [ ] Sync mode- where file(s) or directories are synchronized continuously with another keeping only the latest version. Useful for backing up static data like some script which are updated time to time or security keys like ssh or gpg keys. Use one of the following modes
    1. [ ] Compressed backup - tar ball of data (Reduces disk-space usage)
    2. [ ] Rsync: using `rsync`
    3. [ ] Add option for user-defined time interval to sync data

3. [ ] Incremental mode: Where incremental backups are created like any other backup app. Use one of the following modes
    1. [ ] Compressed backup - tar ball of data (Reduces disk-space usage)
    2. [ ] Rsync: using `rsync`
    1. [ ] Add option for user-defined time interval to backup data

## Dependencies
### Build Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to build **LeapTime Manager**.
```$
gettext
desktop-file-utils
libglib2.0-bin
gtk-update-icon-cache
meson
python3
python3-sphinx
python3-sphinx-argparse
```
### Runtime Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run **LeapTime Manager**.
```
gir1.2-xapp-1.0
gir1.2-gtk-3.0
python3
python3-apt
python3-aptdaemon.gtk3widgets
python3-configobj
python3-gi
python3-setproctitle
python3-tldextract
```

### Debian/Ubuntu based distro
To install runtime dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu based systems, run:
```
sudo apt install gir1.2-xapp-1.0 gir1.2-gtk-3.0 python3 python3-aptdaemon.gtk3widgets \
python3-configobj python3-gi python3-setproctitle python3-tldextract
```
**Note**: If you are using `gdebi` to install **LeapTime Manager** from a downloaded/built `.deb` file, it will automatically install the dependencies and you can skip this step.

### Other Linux-based distro
Replace `apt install` in the command given in [Debian/Ubuntu based distros](#debianubuntu-based-distro) and use the command for the package manager of the target system(eg. `yum install`, `dnf install`, `pacman -S` etc.)

**Note**: There might be cases where one or more dependencies might not be available for your system. But that is highly unlikely. In such situations, please [create an issue](#issue-tracking-and-contributing).

## Installation
There are two ways, this app can be installed on a Debian/Ubuntu based system.

### 1. Download and install binary files
Download the latest binary .deb files from [here](https://github.com/mamolinux/leaptime-manager/releases/latest). Then install the GUI Frontend from terminal as
```$
sudo dpkg -i leaptime-manager*.deb
sudo apt install -f
```

### 2. Build and Install From Source
If you are having trouble installing the pre-built binary, build them from the source.

#### Debian/Ubuntu based systems
There are two methods, this app can be installed/used on a Debian/Ubuntu based system. First, download and unzip the source package using:
```
wget https://github.com/mamolinux/leaptime-manager/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd leaptime-manager-master
```

1. **Option 1:** Manually copying necessary files. For that, follow the steps below:
	1. Install python package sources using `meson`:
		```bash
		rm -rf builddir
		meson setup -Dprefix=$HOME/.local builddir
		meson compile -C builddir --verbose
		meson install -C builddir
		```
		It will install all files under `/home/<yourusername>/.local`. To **remove** the locally (`/home/<yourusername>/.local`) installed files, run:
		```bash
		ninja uninstall -C builddir
		```
	2. To manually install for all users:
		```bash
		rm -rf builddir
		meson setup builddir
		meson compile -C builddir --verbose
		sudo meson install -C builddir
		```
		The last step requires **Administrative Privilege**. So, be careful before using this. To **remove** the installed files, run:
		```bash
		sudo ninja uninstall -C builddir
		```

2. **Option 2:** Build a debian package and install it. To build a debian package on your own:
	1. from the `leaptime-manager-master` run:
		```bash
		dpkg-buildpackage --no-sign
		```
		This will create a `leaptime-manager_*.deb` package at `../leaptime-manager-master`.
	
	2. Install the debian package using
		```bash
		sudo dpkg -i ../leaptime-manager_*.deb
		sudo apt install -f
		```
After it is installed, run `leaptime-manager` from terminal or use the `leaptime-manager.desktop`.

#### Other Linux-based systems
1. Install the [dependencies](#other-linux-based-distro).
2. From instructions for [Debian/Ubuntu based systems](#debianubuntu-based-systems), follow **Option 1**.

	cd leaptime-manager-master
	```
2. Make desired modifications.
3. Manually install using [option 2](#2-build-and-install-from-source).
